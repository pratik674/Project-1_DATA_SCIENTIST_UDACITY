There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb Open Data from 2016 to better understand:

How would you describe the vibe of a neighbourhood? What is the vibe of the neighbourhood in Seattle? 
What is the busiest time of the year? what is price variations annually observed? By how much does the price vary in the busiest season?
Is there any trend of visitors through time? IS there any trend of number of listings by hosts over time?


File Descriptions
There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

There is an additional .py file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict price.

Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.
