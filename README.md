### Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. This code will run with no issues using Python version 3.*
Nevertheless, the libraries that were used for this project includes pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn. 

### Project Motivation
For this project, i was interested in using Airbnb data (2016) from Seattle, U.S.A. 
Airbnb being a primary rental service Industry, includes data obtained from hosts and guests or visitors spread across multiple neighbourhoods. 
The data invokes questions related to multiple factors, like neighbourhood of choice, cost variation for neighbourhoods across time and number of guests, hosts and listings variation and host revenue. Attempts has been made to answer the following questions :
  a. What is the vibe of a neighbourhood?
  b. What is the busiest time of the year to visit Seattle? How does the price vary over time and by how  much?
  c. What is the trend of number of hostings and listings over time? 
  d. What is the occupancy rate, for thirty days, in the neighborhood? What is the revenue generatedfor the hosts?
  
### File description
There are four notebooks, pertaining to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.

### Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available at https://medium.com/@iitkgp.pratik/would-you-rather-be-a-host-or-a-guest-for-airbnb-in-seattle-1336a3f86c92
