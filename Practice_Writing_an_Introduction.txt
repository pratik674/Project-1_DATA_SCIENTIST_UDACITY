Do you know what makes you tick in 2023?
Time dictates everything and timely informed decisions paves way for your future. Right from the beginning we always have made choices, be it in our personal or professional lives. Have you ever wondered what your future could be if you had  a more detailed analysis of the parameters affecting these choices? Would you have chosen a different career? Invested in a different financial institution? Bought a home any differently? 
The primary question, for anyone, including me, while pursuing my Master's was:
1. What is current placement scenario? How sensistive is it with the fluctuating economy over the years? 
2. What is the average Salary over the areas? How does salary vary with demography? Is it gender biased?
3. What is the work life balance scenario?

To analyze this data not excluding Demography, Education degree, current and expected Salary Job satisfaction has been compiled over a wide spectrum of gender, age-group candidates. All this to simply understand the past and the current response affecting Placement, Salary and Job Satisfaction.
